# QF_ComputationalFinance

A set of solved exercises from the UniBo QF course "Computational Finance".
In the present work, I strongly avoid (whenever is reasonably feasible) to
use any kind of builtIn function. No external libraries are used. For example,
I never make use of the method string.replace() and I build method of my own to
do that.

In building PricingLibrary, however, I will make use of math and other external libraries.

If you happen to find any mistakes and/or any suggestions, please let me know!

If you have any interesting exercise, send it to me!!! :D
