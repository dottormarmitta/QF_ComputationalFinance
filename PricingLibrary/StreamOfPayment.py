# #  Here I want to create an object consisting of   # #
# #  a stream of payments, which is often used in    # #
# #  finance and financial applications. Ideally,    # #
# #  treat this as an array of floating numbers.     # #
# #                                                  # #

# My Object:
class StreamOfPayments:

    # Constructor:
    # I expect the following parameters:
    #
    # 1. paymentsTime MUST BE a list
    # 2. paymentsValue can either be a FLOAT (as constant payment) or LIST
    # 3. discountingFactors MUST BE a list
    def __init__(self, paymentsTime, paymentsValue, discountingFactors):

        # Some error checking on input:
        if not isinstance(paymentsTime, list):
            raise Exception("Wrong input type.")
        if not isinstance(paymentsValue, list):
            if isinstance(paymentsValue, float):
                paymentsValue = [paymentsValue]*len(paymentsTime)
        if not isinstance(discountingFactors, list):
            raise Exception("Wrong input type.")
        if not len(paymentsTime) == len(discountingFactors) and len(discountingFactors) == len(paymentsValue):
            raise Exception("Lengths do not agree.")

        # Building main field of my object
        # I find convenient to store the payment stream inside a dictonary: in this
        # way I can easily access the payments by their location in times!
        #
        # paymentStream = {time: [value, discounting]}
